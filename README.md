## Here is the project "Arduino Box"


Make a mystery box running under Arduino. It will be self-powered and will open only by sequentially performing certain actions.
Features:
- Counter / timer> Starts at 60:00 over at 00:00
- A hidden push-button to restart the game (RESET / ON-OFF)
- A hidden button to open the hatch
- 4 switches
- 3 led (one by step)
- A mechanism closing the limping


### the goal is to open a box after several steps

1. __ Step 1 __
  * Sequence to enter switches
      - example: 2x Switch No. 1 / 1x Switch No. 2 / 1x Switch No. 3 / 1x Switch No. 4

2. __ step 2 __
  * Obstruct 2 or 3 sensors in a specific order

3. __ Step 3 __
    * Enter a rhythm sequence on the box (vibration sensor) or recognize a sound (a word or a musical tune?)

__ ** Then the box opens.** __
